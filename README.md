## 🎉 Featured Projects:

- **[MindCare](https://github.com/Zeida/MindCare)**: For my final degree project, I developed a software tool that addresses the crucial role of emotional well-being in our daily lives. Understanding that our emotional state can influence our ability to think, feel, and act, this application leverages technology to promote personal well-being.

  MindCare offers a variety of resources for self-care, emotional support, and social interaction, all enhanced with a unique badge system that motivates users in their personal growth journey. Additionally, it serves as a valuable resource for professionals in therapeutic processes, supporting the promotion of healthy habits.

## 🥰 Life Beyond Coding
When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in a world of creativity and passion! 📚✨ 

I enjoy reading works from great authors like Unamuno and Saramago, along with thought-provoking books like Homo Deus. My taste in music is eclectic with Extremoduro 🤘🏼being my all-time favorite band! 🎶

Nature calls to me as I love hiking and camping⛺️, exploring the beauty of the outdoors. I also take joy in caring for plants and fish; my cozy fish tank is home to some vibrant inhabitants, while my collection of succulents, a bonsai, a Calathea and others wonderful plants keeps my space lively. 🌿🐠

Art is another passion of mine, and I find great joy in drawing and crafting. Whether it’s working on models or solving puzzles, my creativity flows freely. 🎨🧩

As a cinematic enthusiast 🎥, I appreciate classic and acclaimed films, with Léon: The Professional and The Butterfly Effect being my top picks. 🍿 I also enjoy a good binge-watch, catching up on shows like Adventure Time, The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, This Is Us, Cortar por la Línea de Puntos, Euphoria, The Last of Us, and Merlí. 📺

On the linguistic front🌍, I have a B1 level in English and enjoy writing, listening, and reading it, although speaking isn’t my greatest passion. I’ve always wanted to learn Euskera and Portuguese because I find those languages fascinating! 🌍🗣️

Having trained as a leisure and free-time monitor, I’m always open to exploring new paths, whether it’s as a bookseller, a farmer, or another occupation non relative to IT. Life is all about embracing new experiences! 🌟

And here’s a little secret 🤫: unlike many developers, I actually enjoy generating documentation! It’s my hidden superpower! 🦸‍♂️
